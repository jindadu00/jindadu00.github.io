I am a Ph.D student at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), advised by Prof. 
[Xiangyang Zhu (朱向阳)](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/teacher_directory1/zhuxiangyang.html). I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering (B.Eng.) degree in Engineering Mechanics, with a minor in Computer Science and Technology, from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU), graduating with honors as the top student in my major through [Zhiyuan Honor Program](https://en.zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/). This academic background has fueled my interest in a wide range of robotics topics, from traditional control and mechanics modeling to reinforcement learning, deep learning, and their applications in dexterous manipulation, tactile perception, generative algorithms, motion planning, and force control.

I was awarded the Outstanding Winner and the INFORMS Award in the 2021 Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM) and received the First Prize in the National Zhou Peiyuan Mechanics Competition the same year. 

I enjoy guitar🎸 and VAE (Song Xu)'s music🎶. If someone invites me to play volleyball 🏐 or go snowboarding 🏂, I'll definitely join!


<!-- I work at TikTok <img src='./images/tiktok.png' style='width: 6em;'> as a research scientist now in Singapore. 

I am now working on audio-driven talking face generation, text-to-speech and music generation research. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [ren.yi@bytedance.com](mailto:ren.yi@bytedance.com). We are hiring interns!

I graduated from [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/main.htm), Zhejiang University (浙江大学竺可桢学院) with a bachelor's degree and from the Department of Computer Science and Technology, Zhejiang University (浙江大学计算机科学与技术学院) with a master's degree, advised by [Zhou Zhao (赵洲)](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhaozhou). I also collaborate with [Xu Tan (谭旭)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xuta/), [Tao Qin (秦涛)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/taoqin/) and [Tie-yan Liu (刘铁岩)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/) from [Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/machine-learning-research-group/) <img src='./images/microsoft_logo.svg' style="width: 4em;"> closely. 

I won the [Baidu Scholarship](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%99%BE%E5%BA%A6%E5%A5%96%E5%AD%A6%E9%87%91/9929412) (10 candidates worldwide each year) and [ByteDance Scholars Program](https://ur.bytedance.com/scholarship) (10 candidates worldwide each year) in 2020 and was selected as one of [the top 100 AI Chinese new stars](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4NzQ5MTA2NA==&mid=2653639431&idx=1&sn=25b6368c1954419b9090840347d9a27d&chksm=8be75b90bc90d286a5af3ef8e610e822d705dc3cf4382b45e3f14489f3e7ec4fd8c95ed0eceb&mpshare=1&scene=2&srcid=0511LMlj9Qv9DeIZAjMjYAU9&sharer_sharetime=1620731348139&sharer_shareid=631c113940cb81f34895aa25ab14422a#rd) and AI Chinese New Star Outstanding Scholar (10 candidates worldwide each year). 

My research interest includes speech synthesis, neural machine translation and automatic music generation. I have published 50+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4FA6C0AAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2FRayeRen%2Frayeren.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences such as NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, KDD. 

To promote the communication among the Chinese ML & NLP community, we (along with other 11 young scholars worldwide) founded the [MLNLP community](https://space.bilibili.com/168887299) in 2021. I am honored to be one of the chairs of the MLNLP committee. -->
