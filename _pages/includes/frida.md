Interactive Drawing Robot Project

Hardware Design: Developed a low-cost XYZ-structure CNC plotter to replace expensive robotic arms, using stepper and servo motors for precision control in X, Y, and Z axes. Implemented Arduino microcontroller to manage motion via G-code.
Software Development: Designed Python scripts for image-to-G-code conversion and implemented real-time control using Processing IDE. Enhanced image processing pipeline with threshold segmentation, morphological operations, and mask application for dynamic drawing generation.
